# AMPED Server
A C implementation of the AMPED server design described in the Flash paper by Vivek S. Pai, Peter Druschel, and Willy Zwaenepoel in 1999. This server is a proof of concept, and therefore does not follow any standrad protocals. It simply receives a filepath and returns the contents of the requested file. 

Developed with Zhitao Zhang for CSE 550, Introduction to Computer Systems and Research.
